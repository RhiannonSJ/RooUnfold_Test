RooUnfold is a framework for unfolding (AKA "deconvolution" or "unsmearing").
It currently implements three methods: iterative (Bayes), SVD,
and bin-by-bin (simple correction factors).
It can be used from the ROOT prompt, or linked against the ROOT libraries.

RooUnfold requires ROOT 4 or later.


Building
========

Use GNU make. Just type

  make

to build the RooUnfold shared library.

Running
=======

RooUnfoldExample.cxx makes a simple test of RooUnfold.

  % root
  root [0] gSystem->Load("libRooUnfold")
  root [1] .L examples/RooUnfoldExample.cxx
  root [2] RooUnfoldExample()

More involved tests, allowing different toy MC PDFs to be used for training
and testing, can be found in examples/RooUnfoldTest.cxx.
To run RooUnfoldTest from within ROOT, RooFit is normally used.
RooFit can be loaded with

  root [1] gSystem->Load("libRooFit")
  root [2] .L examples/RooUnfoldTest.cxx
  root [3] RooUnfoldTest()

RooFit is not required to use the RooUnfold classes from another program
(eg. examples/RooUnfoldExample.cxx).

You can change the options for RooUnfoldTest:

  root [4] RooUnfoldTest(2,0,5,3)

The example programs can also be run from the shell command line.

  % make bin
  % ./RooUnfoldTest

and the output appears in RooUnfoldTest.ps

For a 2-D example look at RooUnfoldTest2D that works in a similar way.


Testing in ROOT 4
=================

The test programs, examples/RooUnfoldTest.cxx and examples/RooUnfoldTest2D.cxx,
use RooFit to generate the toy distributions. Hand-coded alternatives are
provided if RooFit is not available (eg. running in ROOT 4). In some cases,
this may not normalise the plotted generator PDF curve properly, but that's just
a cosmetic problem.

To disable the use of RooFit, #define NOROOFIT before loading RooUnfoldTest*.cxx

  root [1] #define NOROOFIT 1
  root [2] .L examples/RooUnfoldTest.cxx
  root [3] RooUnfoldTest()

For the stand-alone case, use

  make bin NOROOFIT=1

to build (this is the default if RooFit is not available).


Documentation
=============

See http://www.slac.stanford.edu/~adye/RooUnfold/RooUnfold.html or make
your own:

  root [5] THtml html
  root [6] html->MakeAll()

This creates an htmldoc subdirectory.


Notes on the RooUnfHisto Class
==============================

The RooUnfHisto class can be used independently of the RooUnfold interface
for unfolding (equidistant 1D) histograms. The method uses a singular
value decomposition of the detector response matrix, which has to be provided
as a 2D quadratic histogram. The covariance matrix on the unfolded spectrum
can be determined using toy studies.
ROOT version 4 is needed for the singular value decomposition.
The code was originally implemented by
Kerstin Tackmann (kerstin@slac.stanford.edu) for the unfolding of the
hadronic mass spectrum in B->Xu l nu on the recoil of fully reconstructed
hadronic B decays and the tests have been done using this spectrum.
