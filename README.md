# RooUnfold_Test
Playing with RooUnfold on a preliminary example

--------------------------------------------------

## Testing the existing RooUnfold examples
    - See how to use it for a simple 1D smearing exercise
    - Work out how to implement to my own work

## Testing on 1D histograms from my generations
    - Initially use neutrino energy
        - Truth
        - Reco
    - Eventually use slices, maybe

## Testing on 2D histograms from my generations
    - cos theta mu vs. Tmu
    - Smeared and truth to train
    - Expectation to test

## Preliminary cross section calculation
    - Unfolding
    - Fluxes
    - Covariance
